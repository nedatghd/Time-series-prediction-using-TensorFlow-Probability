# A time series forecasting model utilizing TensorFlow Probability's Structural Time Series (TFP STS) framework to project future values of a specific dataset includes:
## Monitoring the Loss Function:

- Implement a system to observe the training loss throughout the model optimization process.
- Ensure that the loss function decreases over time and reaches a stable point, indicating convergence.
- Incorporate regular logging and visualization of the training loss.
